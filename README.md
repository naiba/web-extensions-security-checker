# Web Extensions Security Checker

Automatically check the status of extensions in the Chrome Web Store.

Sometimes the browser extensions we install can be acquired by people with ulterior motives and thus do evil.
This extension is a lifesaver when Chrome Web Store alerts are not forthcoming. This extension will alert you when an installed extension has been taken down by the Chrome Web Store.
